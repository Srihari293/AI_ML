## Overview
In this course we take a code first approach to learn about the algorithms and techniques required for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. We use a Legobot equipped with a LiDARs, motors, controller and caterpillar system. The goal is to learn and implement state of the art localization and mapping models to drive around in an arena with cylindrical obstacles.
