# Unit A: Motion model, Landmark detection and LiDAR data analysis
## Sensor Suite
The robot consists of a 2D LiDAR scanner as the main sensor and wheel encoders to measure position. The wheel encoder counts the ticks per rotation for both the wheels and this helps us compute the distance travelled by the robot in mm. 
> **Note:**
> When the wheel encoders move in different speeds, the robot turns


## Wheel encoder data:
The wheel encoder data is collected in the *robot4_motors.txt* in the following format.
